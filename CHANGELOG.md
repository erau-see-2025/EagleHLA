# Changelog

Embry-Riddle students participating in the 2025 NASA SEE program have made
modifications to enable the use of open-source RTIs with TrickHLA for local
development purposes. This primarily involves updating /makefiles/S_hla.mk
to support these additional RTI "vendors." Changes are marked with comments
referencing ERAU.
